<!-- This is a placeholder for your SMA logo -->
<!-- 
To implement your actual logo:

1. Save your JPEG logo as: static/images/sma-logo.jpg
2. Make sure the filename is exactly: sma-logo.jpg (lowercase)
3. Refresh your browser

The logo will appear in:
- Header/Navigation area (small size)
- Main content area on homepage (large size)

Both locations have fallback icons if the logo file is missing.
