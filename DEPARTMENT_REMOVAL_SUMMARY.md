### **Simplified Organization**
```
Shahriar's Medical Academy
├── Students (organized by batches)
├── Batches (main organizational unit)
├── Teachers (with specializations)
├── Courses (department-independent)
└── Fees (multi-currency support)
```

### **ID Generation Patterns**
- **Students**: `STU-{year}-{number}` (e.g., STU-2024-0001)

### **Key Relationships**
- **Student** → **Batch** (many-to-one)
- **Teacher** → **Batch** (coordinator, many-to-one)
- **Course** → **Batch** (many-to-many)
- **Student** → **Course** (through grades)
