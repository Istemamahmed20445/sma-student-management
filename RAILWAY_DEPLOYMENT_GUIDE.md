2. Sign up/Login with GitHub
3. Click "New Project" ‚Üí "Deploy from GitHub repo"

### 4. Update ALLOWED_HOSTS
After deployment, Railway will give you a URL like:

Update the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` variable to include your specific Railway URL:
```
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1,*.railway.app,*.up.railway.app,sma-student-management-production-xxxx.up.railway.app
```

### 5. Create Superuser
After deployment, you'll need to create an admin user:
1. Go to Railway dashboard ‚Üí Deployments
2. Click on your deployment
3. Go to "Logs" tab
4. Click "Open Shell"
5. Run: `python manage.py createsuperuser`

### 6. Test PWA Installation
Once deployed, your app will be available at your Railway URL with HTTPS:
- ‚úÖ **HTTPS**: Automatically provided by Railway
- ‚úÖ **Service Worker**: Will work with HTTPS
- ‚úÖ **Manifest**: Already configured
- ‚úÖ **Icons**: Already uploaded
- ‚úÖ **Install Prompts**: Will work on all devices!

## üì± PWA Testing

### Desktop Testing:

2. Look for install icon (‚¨áÔ∏è) in address bar
3. Click to install the PWA

### Mobile Testing:

2. Look for "Add to Home Screen" prompt
3. Or use browser menu ‚Üí "Add to Home Screen"

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

2. **Static Files Not Loading**: Ensure `STATIC_ROOT` is set correctly
3. **Database Error**: Verify PostgreSQL is added and `DATABASE_URL` is set
4. **PWA Not Installing**: Ensure HTTPS is working (Railway provides this automatically)

### Useful Commands:
```bash
# Check deployment logs
railway logs

# Open shell in Railway
railway shell

# Run Django commands
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
